## Security Warning

All steps, scripts, commands etc. present here are primarily for education and understanding cryptographic algorithms and schemes. As such, a lot of steps taken are not the best practice in terms security, for instance, sourcing randomness or key generation.

Do not use anything here in production without proper research.

# Elliptic Curve cryptography

This section focuses on cryptography using Elliptic Curves. This is of two types:

* ECDH
* EdDSA

## ECDH

Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman is a key exchange protocol, which allows two parties each with an asummetric key pair (private/public keys) to derive a shared secret, using just said keys.

It is [covered here](./ecdh/README.md).

## EdDSA

Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm is an algorithm to sign messages using a key based on elliptic curves, as opposed to RSA keys.

It is covered **TODO**
